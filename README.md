# Color Flow Circuit ðŸŒˆ

Color Flow Circuit is an engaging puzzle game where players create and mix color paths to solve increasingly challenging levels. Built with modern Android development technologies and featuring smooth animations, cosmic themes, and intuitive touch controls. This is a personal project that I could expand on in the future, mainly to test making an Android Application.
## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

Players navigate through 10 progressively challenging levels where they:
- Draw paths from color sources to receivers
- Mix colors using mixer nodes to create new colors
- Solve puzzles while avoiding path intersections
- Complete levels by matching all receiver color requirements
